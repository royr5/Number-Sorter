# Number Sorter

The Number Sorter is an MVC web app built with C# on the .NET Core framework. It allows users to input a set of numbers, sort them in ascending or descending order, and store the results along with the sort direction and duration in a Microsoft SQL database. Users can view past sorts and export the data as JSON.
